summary: This note introduces the basic understanding of evapotranspiration (ET) as an exchange of water and energy when liquid water on a surface (land or ocean) becomes gaseous form in the atmosphere  - How much ET usually depends on whether energy or water availably is limiting along with the capacity of the atmosphere to hold water - A basic conceptual model covers the drivers of water availability (precipitation and storage) and energy availability (atmospheric and surface conditions) as well as the role played by plants

## Overview
Evapotranspiration (definitions) - LLM - 
## Energy versus Water Limitation

- **Energy  Drivers:**  
  ET is driven by the energy available at the land surface. The balance between incoming solar radiation and the energy used for heating the surface, along with latent heat flux (associated with water evaporation and plant transpiration), governs the rate of ET.
- **Diffusion Drivers**
    Because ET is a diffusion process, vapor pressure deficits in the air impact ET rates; mixing of air at the evaporating surface (driven by wind and surface roughness) as well as boundary layer atmopsheric conditions impact diffuse rates

- **Water Availability Drivers:**  
  Precipitation is a primary source of water for ET however storage in soils and shallow groundwater systems allow precipitation to be available for ET for longer periods.  Water also moves laterally (by natural and human processes) which allow access to non-local preciptation

## Simple to complex conceptual models

Simple models (#Budyko as conceptual) summarize water availability as simply precipitation; ignore diffusion drivers, and storage/redistribution and for energy assume simple  correlates of energy availability. (such as air tempreature) They have mostly been successful at explaining large scalae (regional to global ) variation in annual ET

Complexity in conceptual model is needed to capture finer scale space-time variation in ET and/or understand drivers of change (includng  changing land surface, vegetation, climate, storage),...
