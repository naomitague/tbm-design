We organize notes to match viz structure - current structure is below
- in any road map you always have access to these "tabs"  as well as an interview/dialogue
-
A road map may jump - e.g from conceptual models right to observations etc. 

Any road map should have notes on all of topics listed below

All topics/notes (bolded below) will have literature associated with them - except space/time which is more a situating in the road map (although sometimes there is literature that might help you think about how to situation yourself space and time )
## Dialog Box
Where user is typing.
- For any pathway
- How will this lead to pathway below - contextual questions - we should think about this

## Space-time Orientation
* Space
	* what is the spatial scale (range of options may be topics specific)
	* what is the location (could be a wide range of locations e.g all plots in sierra nevada)
* Time
	* what is the time scale of interest
	* what is the period of interest (this could include the future as we are often predicting how something will change i)


## Conceptual Models
Conceptual models of current topic (depends on where you are in pathway)
- Includes links to other conceptual models
- Could be figures, text AND can have links to papers (including reviews that provide conceptual modles)

## Hypothesis/Key Ideas
Delve deeper into the topic. You might include:
- **Background/Theory:**  
  Explain the underlying theory or background.
- Working/Frontier Hypothesis
- Well established Hypothesis 


## Related Notes
: is this personal - (e.g your notes)
We also need links to other idea/conceptual models but I think those get integrated above but
we could use for now to track related pathways

- [Related Note 2](path/to/related_note2.md)


## Methods - Models and Observations
- **Could be separate Tabs for Models/Obs**  

- **Models:**  
	  Describe any relevant methods or approaches.
	- Describe how models should be evaluated
		- both context/content (e.g what models account for and what they dont)
		- performance
		- set up complexity other issues
- **Observations**  
	  Describe relevant observations -any datasets or measurement techniques.
	- Describe calibration/validation/issues with observations


## Open Questions / Gaps
Note any uncertainties or research gaps that warrant further investigation.

## Surprises / Novel Insights
Capture unexpected findings or innovative ideas that emerged during your research.
