## Overview
Evapotranspiration (ET) can be measured using a range of methods that operate at different spatial and temporal scales. Each method comes with its own data requirements, strengths, and limitations. Combining multiple methods can provide a more comprehensive view of ET dynamics. This note outlines several commonly used techniques.

## Measurement Methods

### Tree/Plot Scale

# [[Measurements - Sap flow|Sap Flow]]

## Pan Evaporation
- **Description:**  
  Uses standardized pans to measure evaporation, which can be correlated with ET.
- **Scale of Measurement:**  
  Localized measurements based on pan placement.
- **Strengths:**  
  - Simple and cost-effective.
  - Easy to deploy and maintain.
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Can overestimate ET as it does not account for the effects of vegetation.
  - Susceptible to local microclimatic variations.

## Stand Scale
### Eddy Covariance
- **Description:**  
  Uses high-frequency measurements to determine water vapor flux between the land surface and the atmosphere.
- **Scale of Measurement:**  
  Ecosystem scale (typically covering 1 kmÂ² or more).

- **Strengths:**  
  - Provides continuous, real-time data.
  - Captures integrated ecosystem-level ET.
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - High cost and technical complexity.
  - Data processing and quality control can be challenging.


## Inference of ET


# Plot Scale

### Lysimeters
- **Description:**  
  Enclose a soil volume to directly measure changes in water storage, isolating ET.

- **Strengths:**  
  - Provides accurate, direct measurements of ET.
  - Ideal for calibrating other measurement methods.
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Limited spatial representativeness.
  - Expensive and often not feasible for large-scale studies.



## Remote Sensing Estimates of ET
- **Description:**  
  Derives ET estimates from satellite or aerial imagery using energy balance and vegetation indices.
- **Scale of Measurement:**  
  Cross Scale

- **Strengths:**  
  - Provides spatially extensive coverage.
  - Useful for mapping and monitoring ET over large areas.
- **Weaknesses:**  
  - Dependent on clear-sky conditions and calibration with ground data.
  - Temporal resolution can be limited by satellite revisit times.





## Open Questions / Gaps
- How can multi-scale ET data be integrated for improved accuracy?
- What are the best practices for calibrating remote sensing ET estimates with ground-based measurements?

## Surprises / Novel Insights
- Recent advances in sensor technology and data fusion are narrowing the gap between point measurements and remote sensing estimates.
- Hybrid approaches combining ground measurements and satellite data are emerging as powerful tools for regional ET assessment.
