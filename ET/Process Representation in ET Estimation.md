  This note discusses why capturing all relevant processes—such as snowmelt, forest gaps, disturbances, and litter—is crucial for accurate ET estimates, and how these processes can be represented in models or empirical methods.

## Key Controlling Processes (link to page on complexities)

1. **Snowmelt Dynamics**  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     In mountain regions, snow accumulation and melt can dominate the annual water balance and timing of ET.  
   - **Modeling Approaches:**  
     Physically-based models often include an energy balance snowmelt module. Empirical approaches may rely on snowpack observations and melt factors in training data.

2. **Forest Gaps and Canopy Structure**  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     Gaps or variations in canopy density affect light availability, soil moisture, and microclimate, all of which influence ET rates.  
   - **Modeling Approaches:**  
     Models may parameterize varying leaf area index (LAI) or use gap-specific microclimate data. Empirical methods can incorporate gap area metrics or remote sensing vegetation indices.

3. **Forest Disturbance (e.g., Fire, Insects, Logging)**  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     Disturbances alter stand structure, canopy interception, and soil conditions, changing the partitioning of water between ET and runoff.  
   - **Modeling Approaches:**  
     Process-based models might simulate successional stages post-disturbance. Statistical models need training data from both disturbed and undisturbed sites to capture these effects.

4. **Litter and Soil Layer**  
   - **Why It Matters:**  
     Litter affects soil evaporation and moisture retention, influencing how water is made available for transpiration.  
   - **Modeling Approaches:**  
     Detailed soil modules or litter parameterizations can be included in physically-based models. Empirical approaches often rely on soil moisture measurements that reflect litter’s buffering effect.

## Open Questions / Gaps
- How do we prioritize which processes to include when resources (data, computational power) are limited?
- What methods best capture dynamic processes (e.g., forest recovery post-disturbance) in empirical vs. physically-based models?

## Surprises / Novel Insights
- Recent research shows that small variations in litter depth can substantially affect ET rates in semi-arid forests.
- Machine learning models trained on multi-season snow and vegetation data can approximate physically-based snowmelt routines in some mountain regions.
