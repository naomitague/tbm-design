## What Does "Process-based" Mean?

  In a physically-based model, representation involves explicit equations or modules accounting for phenomena such as snow accumulation/melt, canopy interception, litter layers, and vegetation disturbance.

## Which Processes
	Broad classifications are based on whether the following are included
	* dynanic vegetation

	* chemistry - nutrients, sediment, contaminant
		* particle tracking
	* spatially distributed (versus just spatial)
	* coupled to atmosphere
* Time-space scale 
* Models vary in complexity of process representation and land surface conceptual models

## Examples of Process Based Hydrologic Models
IC (Variable Infiltration Capacity):**  
  A macroscale hydrological model that simulates water balance and energy fluxes using grid-based computations.
- **RHESSys (Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System):**  
  Integrates hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical processes to model landscape dynamics and ET.
- **Other Models:**  
  Models like NOAH-MP and CLM (Community Land Model) also incorporate process based approaches to simulate ET as part of broader land surface and climate modeling frameworks.
