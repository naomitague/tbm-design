summary: |
  This note examines the ecological aspects of evapotranspiration (ET) with an emphasis on how evaporation and transpiration are partitioned in ecosystems, and the influence of plant dynamics and species-specific traits on water use.

## Partitioning of E and T
- **Evaporation (E):**
  - Occurs from soil surfaces, water bodies, and non-vegetated surfaces.
  - Highly influenced by microclimatic conditions, soil moisture, and surface characteristics.
- **Transpiration (T):**
  - Represents water loss via plant stomata.
  - Tends to be regulated by plant physiology, species traits, and phenology.
  
Partitioning ET into these components is essential for understanding ecosystem function, as different plant species and communities have varying transpiration efficiencies.

## Controls on partitioning (scale dependent)
- Individual Plant Structure
	- canopy interception (of snow and rain)
	- stem flow tends increase T over E
	- phenology (T losses low when LAI low)
- Stand structure
	- stand gappiness / stem density
	- litter water holding capacity can increase E but cover reduces soil E loss
	- soil properties
	- species and age of plants


## Implications for Ecosystem Function
- **Stand Water Use Efficiency:**  
  Understanding the partitioning of ET helps evaluate how efficiently ecosystems use water, which is crucial in water-limited environments.
