## Atmosphere
Timing of Precipitation
- **Seasonal and Event-Based Influences:**  
  The timing of precipitation as well as magnitdue impact disconnect between energy-water availability (as mediated by storage), can also impact interception loss and infiltration
Radiation availablity
	- topographic complexity
	- diffuse/direct
	- clouds and fog

# Storage
* storage shapes ET at all space/time scales (papers)
* Storage includes surface storage (canopy, litter, detention (micro scale to lakes), snowpakcs) and subsurface storage that plant roots access (or replensish surface storage for soil evaporation))
* Effect of storage on ET depends on space-time trajectory of inputs 
# Plants
* plants play both active and passive roles in determining ET
* plant shape (height, leaf architectures) change diffuse characterisistics
* plants through roots system access storage often beyond their canopy area and including sometimes deep groundwater storage from non-local areas)
* plant leaves determine the solar radiation, vpd and other drivers of ET at the leaf surface
* plants stomates active control access to stored water; 
* plant phenology changes water/energy above
* at longer time scales plants change their archtecture (including height, roots, stomatal function) which alters ET; at even longer time scales adaption, species change, disturbacne also influence these

# Non-plant Surface properties that change where water is (not just storage)
* how much water infiltraltions and is stored in subsurface can depend on surface infiltraiton properties (pavement, post-soil crusting)
* geologic controls on lateral redistributions at mutliple space scales influence et by changing loccal water availabilty
* human drainage structures - dames, channels, pavement do the same, local detention on roofs


# Navigation the complexities

Whether any of these are important - how they are estimates/measured - depends on time-space scale, extent/period 
So you get there by 
a) integrated models

b) observations in your area, empirical

c) local experiments/studies of the complexities
