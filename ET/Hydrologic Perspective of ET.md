  This note examines the hydrologic perspective of evapotranspiration (ET), focusing on its role in the water cycle, impacts on soil moisture and runoff, and its significance for water resource management.

## Overview
Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component of the hydrologic cycle, acting as a key interface between terrestrial water storage and the atmosphere. Unlike ecological analyses that often focus on partitioning between evaporation and transpiration, this hydrologic perspective examines ET as an integrated process influencing water availability, runoff generation, and overall watershed behavior.

## ET within the Water Cycle
- **Water Balance:**  
  ET is a major pathway for water loss from soils and vegetation, affecting overall water balance in ecosystems and watersheds.
- **Interaction with Precipitation:**  
  ET competes with precipitation for soil moisture, thereby influencing infiltration rates, groundwater recharge, and surface runoff.
- **Feedbacks:**  
  Changes in ET can modify local climate conditions, alter soil moisture dynamics, and impact the timing and magnitude of runoff events.


*This note is part of a broader collection on ET, providing a hydrologic lens on water cycle dynamics and water resource implications.*
