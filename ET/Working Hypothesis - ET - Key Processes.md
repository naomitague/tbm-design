summary: |
  This note discusses why capturing all relevant processes—such as snowmelt, forest gaps, disturbances, and litter—is crucial for accurate ET estimates, and how these processes can be represented in models or empirical methods.

# How does climate impact and land cover change includes ET

[[Conceptual model of ET - complexities]]


1. **There is a proportional reduction in ET with Biomass Reduction**
	1. small disturbances can lead to no change or even increases in ET if
		1. disturbance increase understory, litter and soil evaporation
		2. more water consumptive species grow back
		3. disturbances change snowmelt
2. **Warmer temperature and higher VPD will increase annual ET**
	1. only in water limited locations
		1. Storage in snow or soil can increase ET losses with warming
3. **Earlier Snowmelt Increase annual ET**
4. ** Changes in vegeation structure and composition with warming can overide direct climate impacts on ET**
5. 
		




## Open Questions / Gaps
- How do we prioritize which processes to include when resources (data, computational power) are limited?
- What methods best capture dynamic processes (e.g., forest recovery post-disturbance) in empirical vs. physically-based models?

## Surprises / Novel Insights
- Recent research shows that small variations in litter depth can substantially affect ET rates in semi-arid forests.
- Machine learning models trained on multi-season snow and vegetation data can approximate physically-based snowmelt routines in some mountain regions.

*This note is part of a broader collection on ET, emphasizing how complete representation of key processes ensures more robust and reliable estimates across diverse ecosystems.*
