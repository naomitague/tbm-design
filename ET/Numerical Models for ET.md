summary: >
  This note provides an overview of process‚Äêbased models for evapotranspiration (ET), emphasizing their energy balance focus, key inputs, limitations, and examples such as VIC and RHESSys.

While physics of evaporation are well-understood; estimating the variables involved always require simplifications - the appropriate simplification depends on application (location, scale, time)
Appropriate model depends on Time/Space Scale and whether partitioning between E and T matters.

## Key Controls
- **Atmospheric Controls:**  
	  * Energy -  balance between incoming solar radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes, and ground heat flux.
	  * Diffusion - vapor conductance (atmospheric conductance) depends on boundary layer perperties at the leaf surface (usually modelled by wind speeds, vapor pressure deficit)
- **Water availability:** 
	- Water availability depends on inputs, storage and loss (both through prior ET and drainage)
	- Hydrologic models and measurements are used to define this (link to hydrologic cycle model)
