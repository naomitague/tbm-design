## What Does "Process-based" Mean?

  In a physically-based model, representation involves explicit equations or modules accounting for phenomena such as snow accumulation/melt, canopy interception, litter layers, and vegetation disturbance.


## Why Is Process Representation?

Whole literature on how you do this....



## Strategies for Ensuring Representation (this looks like it came from chat)

## Strategies (or How Process Based Evolves)
- **Comprehensive Data Collection:**  
  Collect data on snow depth, forest structure, litter thickness, and disturbance history to feed into models or empirical frameworks.
- **Model Calibration and Validation:**  
  Use site-specific or process-specific observations to validate that the model accurately represents snowmelt, canopy gaps, and other relevant factors.
- **Iterative Model Development:**  
  Refine or expand the modelâ€™s process modules as new data highlight processes that were previously underestimated or omitted.
