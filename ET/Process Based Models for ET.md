## Overview
Process based models for evapotranspiration (ET) simulate the physical processes governing water and energy exchanges between the land surface and the atmosphere. While physics of evaporation are well-understood; estimating the variables involved always require simplifications - the appropriate simplification depends on application (location, scale, time)
Transpiration includes additional complexities because plants influence available energy (e.g by leaf color, vertical and horizontal distribution(), and water (through roots)- and directly modulate 
et through stomatal control
## Key Characteristics
- **Atmospheric Controls:**  
	  * Energy -  balance between incoming solar radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes, and ground heat flux.
	  * Diffusion - vapor conductance (atmospheric conductance) depends on boundary layer perperties at the leaf surface (usually modelled by wind speeds, vapor pressure deficit)
- **Water availability:** 
	- Water availability depends on inputs, storage and loss (both through prior ET and drainage)
	- Hydrologic models and measurements are used to define this (link to hydrologic cycle model)

## Key Inputs
- **Meteorological Data:**  
  - Solar radiation, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
- **Land Surface Characteristics:**  
  - Soil properties (e.g., texture, moisture capacity), vegetation type, leaf area index (LAI), and canopy cover.
- **Hydrological Parameters:**  
  - Precipitation, runoff, and groundwater contributions.
- **Topography:**  
  - Elevation and slope can influence the distribution of energy and water.

## Downsides / Limitations
- **Complexity and Data Requirements:**  
  These models require detailed, high-resolution data, which may not be available for all regions.
- **Parameter Uncertainty:**  
  Calibration of numerous parameters can introduce uncertainties, particularly in heterogeneous landscapes.
- **Computational Demand:**  
  Process based models can be computationally intensive, especially when applied at high spatial resolutions or over large areas.
- **Simplifications:**  
  Despite their complexity, models often simplify certain processes or interactions, which can limit accuracy in specific conditions.

## Examples of Process Based Models
- **VIC (Variable Infiltration Capacity):**  
  A macroscale hydrological model that simulates water balance and energy fluxes using grid-based computations.
- **RHESSys (Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System):**  
  Integrates hydrological, ecological, and biogeochemical processes to model landscape dynamics and ET.
- **Other Models:**  
  Models like NOAH-MP and CLM (Community Land Model) also incorporate process based approaches to simulate ET as part of broader land surface and climate modeling frameworks.
